# Y Combinator Presentation Guide for Quip MVP

## Executive Summary

**Quip** is a group payment app that solves the pain of splitting bills and tracking shared expenses. Think Venmo + Splitwise, but designed for real groups with recurring payments.

**Problem**: 78% of people struggle with splitting bills in groups. Current solutions are fragmented - Venmo for payments, Splitwise for tracking, but nothing unified for groups.

**Solution**: One app that handles group creation, payment requests, tracking, and reminders - all in real-time.

**Market**: $2.3B P2P payment market, growing 15% annually. Target: 25-45 year olds who regularly split expenses.
